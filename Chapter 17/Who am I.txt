InetSocketAddress, SocketChannel, IP address, host name,
port, Socket, ServerSocketChannel, Thread, thread pool,
Executors, ExecutorService, CountDownLatch, Runnable,
InterruptedException, Thread.sleep()

I need to be shut down or I might live forever - ExecutorService

I let you talk to a remote machine - SocketChannel, Socket

I might be thrown by sleep() and await() - InterruptedException

If you want to reuse Threads, you should use me- Thread pool, ExecutorService

You need to know me if you want to connect to another - IP Address, Host name, port
machine

I’m like a separate process running on the machine - IP Address, Host name, por

I can give you the ExecutorService you need - Thread

You need one of me if you want clients to connect to me - ServerSocketChannel

I can help you make your multithreaded code more predictable - Thread.sleep(), CountDownLatch

I represent a job to run - Runnable

I store the IP address and port of the server - InetSocketAddress
