A class can have any number of these.--> instance variable, method

A method can have only one of these.--> return

This can be implicitly promoted.--> return

I prefer my instance variables private.--> encapsulation

It really means “make a copy.”--> pass by value

Only setters should update these.--> instance variable

A method can have many of these.--> argument

I return something by definition.--> getter

I shouldn’t be used with instance variables.--> public

I can have many arguments--> method

By definition, I take one argument.--> setter

These help create encapsulation.--> getter, setter, public, private

I always fly solo.--> return
