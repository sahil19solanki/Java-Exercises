Given the following compilable statement:

Collections.sort(myArrayList);

1. What must the class of the objects stored in myArrayList implement? - Comparable
2. What method must the class of the objects stored in myArrayList implement? - compareTo()
3. Can the class of the objects stored in myArrayList implement both          -  no
   Comparator AND Comparable?

Given the following compilable statements (they both do the same thing):
Collections.sort(myArrayList, myCompare);
myArrayList.sort(myCompare);
4. Can the class of the objects stored in myArrayList implement Comparable? - yes
5. Can the class of the objects stored in myArrayList implement Comparator? - yes
6. Must the class of the objects stored in myArrayList implement Comparable? - no
7. Must the class of the objects stored in myArrayList implement Comparator? - no
8. What must the class of the myCompare object implement? - Comparator
9. What method must the class of the myCompare object implement? - compare()
