Your job is to play compiler and determine which of these statements would compile.
Some of this code wasn’t covered in the chapter, so you need to work out the answers
based on what you DID learn, applying the “rules” to these new situations.
The signatures of the methods used in the exercise are in the boxes.
BE the Compiler, advanced

private void takeDogs(List<Dog> dogs) { }

private void takeAnimals(List<Animal> animals) { }

private void takeSomeAnimals(List<? extends Animal> animals) { }

private void takeObjects(ArrayList<Object> objects) { }

Compiles?

❑ takeAnimals(new ArrayList<Animal>()); - It will compile

❑ takeDogs(new ArrayList<Animal>()); - It won't compile

❑ takeAnimals(new ArrayList<Dog>()); - It won't compile

❑ takeDogs(new ArrayList<>()); - It will compile

❑ List<Dog> dogs = new ArrayList<>(); - It will compile
takeDogs(dogs);

❑ takeSomeAnimals(new ArrayList<Dog>()); - It will compile

❑ takeSomeAnimals(new ArrayList<>()); - It will compile

❑ takeSomeAnimals(new ArrayList<Animal>()); - It will compile

❑ List<Animal> animals = new ArrayList<>(); - It will compile
takeSomeAnimals(animals);

❑ List<Object> objects = new ArrayList<>(); - It won't compile
takeObjects(objects);

❑ takeObjects(new ArrayList<Dog>()); - It won't compile

❑ takeObjects(new ArrayList<Object>()); - It will compile
