We know this is all new, but have a go at matching each operation name
to the description of what it does. Try not to look at the next page as you
complete it, as that will give the game away!

Check the box if the statement would compile.

❑ Runnable r = () -> System.out.println("Hi!"); - It will compile

❑ Consumer<String> c = s -> System.out.println(s); -It will compile 

❑ Supplier<String> s = () -> System.out.println("Some string"); - It won't compile

❑ Consumer<String> c = (s1, s2) -> System.out.println(s1 + s2); - It won't compile

❑ Runnable r = (String str) -> System.out.println(str); - It won't compile

❑ Function<String, Integer> f = s -> s.length(); - It will compile

❑ Supplier<String> s = () -> "Some string"; - It will compile

❑ Consumer<String> c = s -> "String" + s; - It won't compile

❑ Function<String, Integer> f = (int i) -> "i = " + i; - It won't compile

❑ Supplier<String> s = s -> "Some string: " + s; - It won't compile

❑ Function<String, Integer> f = (String s) -> s.length(); - It won't compile
